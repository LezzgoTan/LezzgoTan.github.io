## Top 3 Characters that are too Overpowered (Teen Titans Battlegrounds)
 In a game full of characters fighting each other, we can't deny some characters can dominate the server easily. Some of them are unstoppable forces, and some are just untouchable from the opponents. We're going to discuss them today and point out what makes them overpowered.


### 3. Terra
Her attacks are certainly strong. Combine it with an escaping skill, you'll have a recipe for an unbalanced overpowered character. Characters who usually have high damage, tend to have lower mobility/survivability. Terra is basically both of them. Her **Rock Path** has a long duration which allows her to engage to the enemy and escape with enough time. Does she have a direct or close counter? Yeah Beast Boy. But even Beast Boy can't handle her entire damage.

### 2. Dr. Light
A character that's difficult to hit with any kind of attack? Yeah, definitely overpowered. He perhaps has the highest survivability out of any characters. His **Light Pillars** have such a low cooldown, that it leaves players having a difficult time timing their attacks against him. Thankfully, he still has close counters. Cyborg's **Sonic Cannon** that can immediately burst down Dr. Light once given the chance. Evil Cyborg's **Battle Dome** can reduce Dr. Light's dashing distance which can help him burst him down while trapped.

### 1. Evil Beast Boy
Alright, he's basically the real meaning of overpowered. He has **Raptor Form** for his mobility, **Elephant Form** for tremendous damage, **Pterodactyl Form** for air mobility and range attack. He can defeat most normal characters with just 3 strikes from **Elephant Form.** Unlike the other two characters mentioned above, he has no direct counter nor a close counter. What's worse is that he has the least difficulty out of the anyone in this list. He's way too easy to use for a strong character.
